Currently, I am a senior engineer at [Bonsai](https://joinbonsai.co/jz/) where we're building and designing tools for artists, musicians, and creators connect with each other and build sustainable careers.

I'm on the board of the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/), and have been helping them produce "_[The New Social Environment](https://brooklynrail.org/events)_", a series of daily conversations with artists, writers, filmmakers, and poets from around the world that explore the role that artists and arts organizations play in shaping our society.

Formerly, I oversaw the blogs at _The New York Times_ and launched over 200 blogs with some of the most talented writers in the world.

I also spent 4 years in the civic tech world at as strategist at 18F and Director of [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/), the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and 22 communities of practice.
