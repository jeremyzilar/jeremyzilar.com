I'm on the board of the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/). Recently, I've been helping the _Rail_ produce "_[The New Social Environment](https://brooklynrail.org/events)_", a series of daily conversations with artists, writers, filmmakers, and poets from around the world.

Formerly, I oversaw the blogs at [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/) and launched over 220 blogs, with some of the most talented writers in the world.

I also spent four years as strategist at 18F and Director of [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/), the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and 22 communities of practice.
