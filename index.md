I am a designer, strategist, and engineer at [Experiments in Art and Design](https://ead.technology/), a design studio with [Juliette Cezzar](https://juliettecezzar.com/).

I recently started [Beeb’s](https://beebsgoods.com/), a small company that sells 100% all-natural dog treats in plastic-free packaging. We are currently selling on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/411B391D-E1FE-4D7B-81B6-CF7705C1F82F) and plan to sell them on our Shopify store in the coming months.

I'm on the board of the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/) and recently helped them build and design a platform for their unique and ambitious archive.

Formerly, I oversaw the blogs at [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/) and launched over 220 blogs, with some of the most talented writers in the world.

I also spent four years working in the Federal Government, first as Strategist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), then as Director of [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/), the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and 22 communities of practice.
