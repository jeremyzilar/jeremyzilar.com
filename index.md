59 Projects is strategic design studio in New Mexico that partners with governments, cultural institutions, and mission-driven organizations to build digital systems, organizational capacity, and strategic clarity.

Formerly, I oversaw the blogs at [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/) and launched over 220 blogs, with some of the most talented writers in the world.

I also spent four years working as a Strategist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), then as Director of [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/), the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and 22 communities of practice.

I recently started [Beeb’s](https://beebsgoods.com/), a small company that sells 100% all-natural dog treats in plastic-free packaging.
