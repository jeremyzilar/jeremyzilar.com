title: Consulting for Artists and Mission-driven Organizations
deck: Human-centered design + strategic business consulting for artists and mission-driven organizations
---


I combine human-centered design and strategic business consulting to help artists and mission-driven organizations to set visions, create strategies, design compelling experiences, and empower their teams to have greater autonomy, confidence, and independence.

I serve as a strategic design partner and guide by immersing myself in a teams unique rhythms, business operations, and artistic process.

I work with teams in New York City that often have staff located around the world to improve the way they work by creating and implementing new physical and digital workflows, rhythms, and communication that better serve the goals of the artist and improve the quality and efficiency of artwork, communication, products, brands, services and artistic environments.
